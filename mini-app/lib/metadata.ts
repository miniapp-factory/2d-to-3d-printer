The app should combine cutting-edge AI technology with a vibrant, modern, and intuitive user experience. Use AI-based depth estimation and photogrammetry to reconstruct real-world depth, lighting, and texture — delivering models that look lifelike, not artificial or blocky. Users can upload photos, capture them directly via their camera, or optionally use LiDAR-enabled devices for enhanced depth accuracy. Needs to be Android and ISO compatible.";
