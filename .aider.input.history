+Code the following app
+```
+App Prompt
+App Name:
+2D to 3D PRINTER
+Tagline:
+Transform 2D pictures into 3D printer-ready files.
+App Description
+Create a beautiful, AI-powered mobile application that converts 2D images into realistic, high-fidelity 3D models. The app should combine cutting-edge AI technology with a vibrant, modern, and intuitive user experience.
+Use AI-based depth estimation and photogrammetry to reconstruct real-world depth, lighting, and texture — delivering models that look lifelike, not artificial or blocky. Users can upload photos, capture them directly via their camera, or optionally use LiDAR-enabled devices for enhanced depth accuracy. Needs to be Android and ISO compatible.
+Core Features
+1. Image Preparation & Smart Cropping
+• Once a picture is uploaded or captured, allow users to optionally draw around the desired object or subject in the photo.
+• Use AI-powered auto-cropping to intelligently detect and isolate the selected area.
+• The crop should be adjustable, allowing users to fine-tune the selection before proceeding.
+• This ensures that only the intended image portion is used in the 2D-to-3D conversion process, improving accuracy and reducing noise. 
+2. The 2D-to-3D Conversion
+• Implement AI vision models (MiDaS, DPT, or Gaussian Splatting) to estimate depth and surface geometry.
+• Generate true-to-life 3D models with accurate lighting, proportion, and material reflection.
+• Ensure smooth rendering transitions during model creation (animated “depth reveal” effect).
+• Optional LiDAR Support: Users with LiDAR-enabled devices can capture point cloud data to improve depth precision and generate highly accurate 3D models. LiDAR can be combined with 2D images to enhance surface detail, scaling, and real-world accuracy.
+3. Scaling & Measurement Tools
+• Allow users to scale models using metric units (mm, cm, m).
+• Provide an interactive 3D viewport with smooth pinch-to-zoom, rotate, and pan gestures.
+• Include gridlines or AR-guided scale overlays for precision. Allow users to edit and adjust the model if needed.
+4. File Export Options
+• Export in multiple 3D printing-ready formats (.STL, .OBJ, .3MF, .G-CODE, .AMF).
+• Allow compression or high-detail export modes.
+• Preview export size and complexity before downloading.
+5. Performance & AI Processing
+• Support on-device AI for fast local tasks and cloud rendering for advanced models.
+• Display an elegant progress bar with a glowing or wave animation during processing.
+• Combine LiDAR point clouds with AI depth estimation for devices with LiDAR, producing the most precise 3D reconstructions.
+User Interface (UI/UX Design)
+Design a colorful yet minimal interface with vibrant gradients, futuristic neon look, and smooth animations. The look should feel professional, futuristic, and intuitive — similar to Apple’s Vision Pro or Adobe Firefly aesthetic.
+Visual Style & Feel:
+• Color Palette: Deep purples, electric blues, and subtle neon accents.
+• Typography: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or SF Pro).
+• Icons: Rounded, glowing icons for key actions (e.g., “Upload Photo,” “Generate 3D Model”).
+• Motion Design: Use micro-interactions (hover glow, tap ripple, animated transitions between 2D → 3D).
+UI Layout:
+• Futuristic neon UI for the 2D-to-3D app, glowing gradients in deep purple and electric blue, luminous rounded icons, smooth animated transitions, holographic depth indicators, reflective surfaces, subtle neon accents, intuitive and minimal layout, cyberpunk sci-fi aesthetic with cinematic lighting and immersive glow.
+• Home Screen: Two large buttons — “Take Photo” and “Upload Photo.”
+• After Upload: Launch the smart cropping interface with draw-to-select and AI auto-crop adjustment.
+• Bottom Navigation Bar: Home, My Projects, Generate, Settings.
+• 3D Preview Screen: Gradient background, easy gesture control, fullscreen toggle.
+Allow users to edit and make adjustments to model if needed before and after 2D to 3D conversion.
+Storage & Sharing
+• Allow users to save projects locally or sync with cloud storage.
+• Enable direct sharing via email, AirDrop, or QR link.
+• Include project gallery thumbnails with a 3D hover effect.
+Technical Requirements
+• Platform: Mobile (Android & iOS)
+• Frontend: Flutter or React Native
+• Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
+• AI Models: MiDaS / DPT / Gaussian Splatting for depth + texture estimation
+• Libraries: Three.js / MeshLab for 3D rendering and exporting
+Optional Add-ons
+• Compare Mode: Toggle between 2D and 3D versions.
+• Basic Editor: Tools for texture smoothing, brightness, and color tuning.
+• Cloud Credit System: For complex rendering workloads.
+• AR Preview Mode: View generated 3D models in real-world space.
+• LiDAR-Enhanced Capture: Optional mode for LiDAR-enabled devices to scan scenes and improve 3D model accuracy and scale precision.
+Overall Experience
+The app should feel dynamic, colorful, and immersive, yet remain simple enough for beginners. Every screen transition should feel fluid — giving users the sense that they’re stepping from photography into another dimension. LiDAR data should integrate seamlessly when available, enhancing realism without altering the core 2D-to-3D experience.
